Let's call your servers:
Server A: us-west-1
Server B: us-west-2

Part 1: Authorize Server A to Connect to Server B
On Server A, log in and generate an SSH key (if you haven't already).

Bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

Press Enter three times to accept the defaults.

On Server A, view and copy the public key.

Bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

On Server B, log in and open the authorized_keys file with nano.

Bash
nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

On Server B, paste the key you copied from Server A onto a new line. Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

âœ… You can now transfer files from A to B.

Example in bash: rsync -avzP tests ubuntu@209.20.156.186:~/codebase2/
